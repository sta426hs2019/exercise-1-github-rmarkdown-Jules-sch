## Exercise 1b)

### First part

First we take 100 samples from a lognormal distribution and plot the histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale.

```{r a}
set.seed(123)
par(mfrow= c(1,2))

x <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = .25)

hist(x, breaks = 15, main = "Histogram of sample")
hist(log(x), breaks = 15, main = "Histogram of sample - on log-scale")

```

### Second part

The mean of the sample is `r mean(x)` and the variance of the sample is `r var(x)`.
